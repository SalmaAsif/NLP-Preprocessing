In Natural Language Processing (NLP), text preprocessing is the first step in the process of building a model.

The various text preprocessing steps are:

1. Tokenization
2. Lower casing
3. Stop words removal
4. Stemming
5. Lemmatization

I used the nltk python library to implement the text preprocessing tasks

pip install nltk
